# smooth quasiBnB
 Code for reconstructing experiments from the paper
 `quasi BnB for smooth global optimization'. 
 To run the code run the file main_script. The three experiments from the paper can be run by choosing appropriate parameters in this    script.
 
 Note that for the sake of readability and time efficienty, code only runs a signal instance of a problem for several solvers, rather than running a multitued of problems and outputting a table or graph summarizing data from all problems.
